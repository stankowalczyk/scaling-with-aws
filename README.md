# Scaling your services with AWS

This repo is here to help you get started with AWS scaling using EC2 instances. This repo is accompanied by a set of blog posts designed to guide you through concepts and demo's to get you on your way to becoming a scaling wizard.

The blogs are posted on the Deakin Software and Technology Innovation Lab's [blog post site](http://dstil.ghost.io/), and the content is split over multiple blog posts (some of which are coming soon).

Please find the resources for the first part of the blog series [here](./Part1Resources/).
