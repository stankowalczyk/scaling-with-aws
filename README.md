# Scaling your services with AWS

This repo is here to help you get started with AWS scaling using EC2 instances. This repo is accompanied by a set of blog posts designed to guide you through concepts and demo's to get you on your way to becoming a scaling wizard.

The blogs are posted on the Deakin Software and Technology Innovation Lab's [blog post site](http://dstil.ghost.io/), and the content is split over multiple blog posts (some of which are coming soon).

The first part of the blog post can be found [here](http://dstil.ghost.io/scaling-with-aws-1). (Alternatively it can be found [here](./Part1Resources/)).
